Just walked out of the theater, mind buzzing and fingers sticky from the popcorn. Novocaine—what a ride, man. Steve Martin being all serious but still funny like a dentist who doesn't know if he's coming or going. That feeling, you know, when you're sure you brushed your teeth but still taste the residual garlic from last night's pizza? Yeah, like that.

Sitting outside now, feeling the cool metal bench seep into my back. There's this ache, like the   left a part of itself lodged in my muscles. Can't tell if it's the thrill or the uncomfortable seats gnawing at my patience. Emily Watson, though—she's like a cat at midnight, sulking but ready to pounce, a real knife-edge performance. Reminds me of the time my cat knocked over my carefully arranged stack of self-help books. Chaotic grace in motion.

> The noise from the theater lobby still echoes in my head, a symphony of candy wrappers and whispers. Patricia Arquette, she floats in the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 like day-olds balloons tethered in a gusty wind, twisted around Martin's steely confusion. Somehow feels intimately close to the time I tried leading a meditation class, only to find out twenty minutes in that I had spinach in my teeth. Have to remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , probably worth a revisit when my brain isn't so scrambled or when the popcorn doesn't feel like sawdust in the mouth.

There's the scene where everything gets tangled in blood and novocaine, quite surreal—reminds me of times when I get tangled in all those email threads about holistic lifestyle shifts. They just seem endless, like a hamster wheel fueled by existential dread, but Martin—he untangles, kinda. The ending, though... still settling. Absurd? Maybe. Resonating deep? Absolutely. Like life shaking hands with chaos.

Yeah, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when you get the chance. It’s like trying to untangle Christmas lights that your cat decided would make a good plaything... what’s with all the cat references today? The tired neurons firing weird patterns like broken neon signs. Oh shoot, someone just texted me about yoga class tomorrow. Totally forgot.

```javascript
function reviewImpression() {
    var thoughts = [scattered, popcorn, Steve Martin];
    while (thoughts.length > 0) {
        console.log(thoughts.pop());
    }
    return novocaine;
}
```

Not sure how that got there. Ha, typical.
